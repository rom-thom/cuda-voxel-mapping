We could do sphare marching to find wether a path is ocupied. Currently i am serching much more area than needed. (https://typhomnt.github.io/teaching/ray_tracing/raymarching_intro/)
We then need to look for the lip shit bound or wathever it is called:
We can know that the minimum distance to the line might be (R_1 + R_2 - s)/2 where s is the distance traveled from the firsst center to the next it is not R_1 because s has a safety margin that is very small but there non the less. For max safety we should have the step size s = R_1/sqrt(3)

Why you might ask, (you Filip probably didnt ask why), its because






We could use CHOMP for smothing out the curve



APF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SÃ¸k opp!!!!!! De va skilkkelig kult og virka effektivt!!!!!!!!! do it!!
